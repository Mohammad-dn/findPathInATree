# Task description

The goal of this task is to find the path to a given node present in a given tree. The tree is a recursive data-type consisting solely of two properties: an id and an items array itself containing `Tree` objects which respresent its children. Given an id you have to find the item in the tree and retrurn the path you had to go through (including the matched node itself) in the form of an array.

The only file you are supposed to modify is treeUtils.ts. You are done if all the tests pass. Keep in mind that the solution needs to be fully typed (no any is allowed, implicit or explicit) and you shouldn't keep global variables (even global to the module) and keep mutations to a minimum. A good solution will have no mutations at all.

Likewise you are not allowed to change the type or mutate the passed to you (i. e. the tree).

Have fun coding!
